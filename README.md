1. Payeezy.js (which is included on the page using a &lt; script> tag) intercepts the form submit, and then
asynchronously posts the credit card details to Payeezy. This call uses JSONP over https, passing in API key and an
identifier– trtoken. Both of these values are provisioned for the merchant‘s developer via the developer portal.
2. On success Payeezy returns a one-time use token (type=payeezy) to payeezy.js. Payeezy.js saves the pertinent
token information in a hidden form field on the checkout form. Failure messages are returned in the response,
which can be handled as appropriate.
3. Payeezy.js then submits the form with the hidden token along with other form info to the merchant server. The
credit card related fields that were used for tokenization are stripped out of the form i.e. the merchant server never
4. Merchants server submits the token to Payeezy to complete the transaction using the appropriate server side
library (optional to use but recommended). This API call uses HMAC authentication, over https. Refer to the
Payeezy developer portal – API Docs and Sandbox section to know more.
5. Payeezy completes the transaction with the provided token (authorization, purchase). The response contains a
new token to use for the related secondary transaction (capture, void, refund). Success/failure message is handled
accordingly by the merchant’s server
